Use the [[https://github.com/muhifauzan/guard-gen/issues][issue tracker]] if you have any questions, bug reports, or feature
requests. Open a [[https://github.com/muhifauzan/guard-gen/pulls][pull request]] when you are ready to contribute.

When you make a pull request, when necessary, make sure to do these:

- Write tests
- Include ~@type~, ~@doc~, and ~@spec~
- Try to match the style convention already resent
- Write a good commit message

Thank you for the help!
